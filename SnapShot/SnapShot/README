    Compile:
        make clean
        make
    Run:
        To launcher all processes all together:
            ./launcher <peer file> <# of snapshots>
        To launcher each process one by one:
            ./application <id> <peer file> <# of snapshots>

    Result:
        The result of the snapshot information will be saved into the file named "snapshot.<id>", where 

Search:
    Usage is of the form:
        ./search [keyword] [sorted] [comparison method] [file]
    
    The search is very similar similar to grep.
    The keyword string is what will be used to match a line, if a line contains the keyword the line will be printed. The second parameter will indicate to turn sorting on, its value can be anything. The third parameter - comparison method - defines how lines will be sorted. Available options are: pid, logical, vector.

    Common examples:
        ./search "snapshot 1" sort logical
        ./search "initiator1"
        ./search "message"
        ./search "snapshot 1" sort pid "snapshot.0"
